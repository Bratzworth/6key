# 6key
This is a 3D-Printable handwired 6 Key Macropad with a DIP switch to change layers and an acrylic bottom. Currently supports MX-style SMK mounts and Cherry MX mounts. This case was designed to be built using a pro-micro or a teensy, and using a relatively standard 1 pole DIP switch ([DS01-254-L-01BE](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/cui-devices/DS01-254-L-01BE/11310875)).
